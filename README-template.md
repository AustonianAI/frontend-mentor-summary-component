## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content - (I haven't done this yet)

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This challenge involved a fair amount of tweaking spacing and getting a layout just right. The Summary data on the right hand side of the component had many elements that needed to be spaced out according to a particular design. Using Tailwind CSS, I accomplished this layout with a variety of flex boxes.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

The next steps here would be to add the react functionality to render the summary data items as a list, with dynamic classes.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Tailwind's docs were my primary guide in getting the styles and layouts correct.
